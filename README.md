## Features



**Navigation around the site:**

The website consists of five different web pages: Home page, Meet us, Plans, Calculator and Contact page. 
Please note - there is no link for the home page within the navigation menu as I have used the website title as a link back to the home page.

The navigation bar changes into a toggler when viewed on a smaller sized screen such as mobile phone. 
When the screen size is shrinks, the “Menu” button appears which then can be clickable to display a dropdown menu that enables the navigation through the app.


**Home Page:**

This home page is quite a basic intro page for the user when they land on the web app. On here I speak about general motivation and the lifestyle of fitness as well as an introduction about what I can do to help the user in term of fitness.

This is quite a short summary to quickly cover what the web app is about.
