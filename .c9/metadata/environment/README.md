Page:**","","","On this page, I have talked about why fitness can help towards a better lifestyle for the human being and I have also provided couple of reasons to back my point. This is mainly to encourage someone that isn't as motivated and to give them that little extra nudge they need.","","Futhermore, I have also offered to provide the user a one on one 1 hour PT session in one of their nearby Pure Gyms.","","To do this, I have also implemented a google maps API which shows the top 20 nearby Pure Gyms around the user as soon as they allow their location to be seen. ","","The google maps API fetches the user's location and shows the nearby Pure Gyms around them however if they disallow this, then the API will revert back to the original location on the map. Furthermore, when the user clicks on one of the nearby gyms, this will display the full name of the gym and the rating that it has been given.","","These features are all responsive within the web app and can enlarge/shrink in a suitable matter to meet the right user experience needs depending on the size of the screen. ","For instance, the large main image at the top becomes hidden when the web app is viewed on mobile and the google maps window shrinks into a square to fit perfectly and suitably on a mobile screen too.","","","**Plans Page:**","","On this page, I have explained what kind of plans I provide for the user to use when training in the gym.","","I have implemented two hyperlink images and subtitles; one for Fat Loss plan and the second is for Muscle Gain plan. These links will take the user to the contact page as they need to get in touch and request these from me by sending an email.","","In terms of responsiveness, The subtitle at the top of the page will be centered on mobile, the large image will shrink to fit right under. The overlapping content box will no longer overlap for cleaner view and be shown as a block under the image.","","The two training plan images are also dispalyed in two different blooks for better user experience and visualisation.","","","**Calculator Page:**","","This page basically contains the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). This calcualtor is basically used for the user to find out what the daily calorie intake needs to be for their body to function correctly.","","I have explained what a BMR is and why it is needed in a paragraph just incase for some users that do not know what it is.","","Under the content section, the calculator has been implemented for both the male and female gendre. This has been implemented through JavaScript to make an automatic calculation which then dispalys the result in an input field for the user after they have filled in the required fields.","","In terms of responsiveness, for a better user experience I have seperated each form in their own blocks to appear under eachother when viewed on smaller screens.","","","**Contact Page:**","","The contact section consists of a form which can be used for the user to get in touch with me directly. This can be used for reaching out and scheduling a one on one session in their nearby pure gym, to request a training plan or to ask for general advice or tips.","","**The footer:**","","","The footer includes links to all my social media pages. In case they want to get in touch through different platforms or view my profile. There is also a disclaimer for copyright at the very bottom of the web app.","","","","**Features to implement in the future:**","","-\tSetting the contact page to send an automated email to the recipient once they submit a successful message delivered to me. This way they receive a confirmation that I did receive their email and will get in touch as soon as possible.","-\tUpload the training plans on the web app and have the user download them instantly rather than requesting them from me by getting in touch to save time.","-\tAdd a macros to calories calcualtor.","-\tAdd a functionality that allows the user to schedule a one on one session with me in one of their nearby Pure gyms.","","","## Technologies used ","","","-\tHTML/HTML5 – This was used to implement most of the content on the site.","-\tCSS – This was used for the design/look and feel of the site.","-\tGit – Used as a repository for version control.","-\tGithub - Used to host the files and the web app itself.","-\tCloud 9 – This is the platform used for developing the web app.","-\tBootstrap – This was used mainly for navigation purposes and to aid in making the web app responsive.","-\tFotnawesome - This was used to fetch the icons for the social media platforms in the footer.","-\tJavaScript – This was used to implement the google maps API as well as the BMR Calculator.","","","## Testing","","### Generic/Journey testing:","","The following have been tested from a user’s perspective to ensure the web app works as expected:","","-\tEasy to navigate around the web app as the navigation bar/drop-down menu is easily visible on the web app.","-\tEach page of the web app easily recognisablea, easy to navigate around and easy to read/understand.","-\tEsily detects the users location (once the user allows to) and displays all nearby gyms for them.","-\tShows clear understanding to the user that this is a fitness based web app.","-\tThe user can easily see what nearby gyms they have around them including the full name and rating.","-\tThe user can easily use the BMR calculator as it is quite basic to use with no complex functionality.","-\tThe user can easily see the calorie intake result when they click submit on the BMR calcualtor as the input field stands out.","-\tThe user is easily able to read all web app content as the font is large and clear.","","","### Manual Testing","","-\tNavigation links:","\tEach navigation link has been tested to ensure that it is linked to the correct page. The navigation link has also been tested when viewed on a smaller screen sizes to ensure the functionality is consistent making sure the toggler is activated correctly.","-\tBMR buttons:","\tBoth the calculate and reset button has been testedfor both gendres. When hitting submit without filling in the fields, this throws a \"Not a Number\" value in the value section. I have also tested that both buttonswork correctly.","-\tTraining plans images/subheading links:","\tI have tested these links to makesure that they redirect correctly to the contact form for the user to get in touch.","-\tGoogle maps API (Allowing location):","\tI have tested this on my end to make sure that when location is enabled, the map shows the exact correct location of my area and displays all 20 nearby gyms.","-\tGoogle maps API (Disallowing location):","\tI have tested this on my end to make sure that when location is disabled, the following message is shown on the map 'Geolocation permissions denied. Using default location.'. I have also tested that the APi also defaults to the main location when user's location is disabled.","-\tGoogle maps API (clicking on the gym marker):","\tI have tested all the markers to make sure that each gym dispalys the full name and the rating.","-\tBMR Calculator:","\tI have tested both gendres for the BMR calculator to make sure that the correct calculation is calculated as implmented in the code.","-\tBMR Calculator (Reset button):","\tI have tested this for both forms to make sure that when the reset button is clicked, all values are removed.","-\tContact form:","\tEach field was tested thoroughly to make sure that the mandatory functionality worked. I have tested the following fields: Full name, email address, Phone and comments section. The form has failed to submit if any of the fields was left blank. I have also tested that the modal window pops up confirming that the form has been submitted when processed successfully.","\tThe email address field has also been tested when trying to insert an invalid email address. The form fails to submit as the email address is not written in the correct format.","\tThe phone number field has also been tested to make sure that it only allows numeric values and no other character.","-\tSocial media icons:","\tThe social media icons in the footer section have all been tested to make sure they are linked correctly and work fine. The “_blank” attribute have also been tested on all of them to make sure that when they are clicked, a new window is open rather than navigating away from the web app.","-\tButton hover:","\tThe button with the hover effect have been tested across the web app. The functionality was working correctly and it changes colour when hovered over.","","All images have been tested to make sure they change size when resizing the screen. Background images were tested to make sure that they are covering each section no matter what the screen size is.","","The web app content was checked and tested to make sure that there was no Grammarly error.","","","","","### Cross browser/device testing:","","**iPad:**","","-\tSafari: The web app has been tested to make sure all sections are appearing correctly on iPad making sure the media queries are working as expected. This has been tested as landscape as well as portrait.","","-\tChrome: The web app has also been tested on the chrome browser making sure it is displayed consistently a long with Safari on the iPad device.","","","**Desktop:**","","-\tChrome: Testing was done to make sure all images/content was displayed clearly on the large desktop screen.","","-\tFirefox: Testing was also carried on Firefox to make sure everything is consistent with chrome.","","","**Android phone:**","","-\tAndroid internet: Tested mainly to make sure the web app is responsive correctly on small screen sizes. This was tested through landscape and portrait orientation.","","-\tChrome: The web app was also tested on chrome mainly for orientation purposes.","","","### Issues found and resolved:","","The main testing was done throughout carrying the project which means that almost all issues were fixed as the implementation carried forward.","","The BMR Description text was coming out the containing box when viewed on mobile phone. The responsiveness was fixed by applying margins to the content box.","","There was Grammarly error in the content under “Implementation Specialist At MaritzCX Jan 18 – Present”. This was fixed during implementation.","","The google maps on the Meetu us page was not displaying correctly in size and not stretching across the container. This was due to certain bootstrap classes which prevented it from showing in width of 100%. The classes have been removed and the map is displayed correctly.","","There was a grammar mistake in the first paragraph on the home page. This was also fixed.","","","","### Left to resolve:","","For the BMR Calculator, the script had to be implemented on the same page as the HTML rather than on a seperate page. The reason for this is that whenever I linked it, the functionality seems to mess up although I do link the Javascript file and the HTML file correctly.","Eventually I will find an alternative to move the JS to a seperate file and get it to work.","","","","## Deployment","","This project was developed using the Cloud9 IDE, this was then committed to git and pushed to GitHub through the terminal within Cloud9.","","To deploy the project from the GitHub repository to GitHub Pages I took the following steps:","","1.\tLogged into GitHub.","2.\tChose Interactive-Frontend-Development-Milestone-Project from the list of repositories.","3.\tSelected Settings from the menu that is just under the respository, it is the last item on the right.","4.\tScrolled down to the section titled GitHib Pages.","5.\tUnder Source clicked the dropdown menu titled None and selected Master Branch.","6.\tThis automatically refreshes the page which took me back to the top.
